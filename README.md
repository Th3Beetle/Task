1. OddWord
Find a string of a given length such that each letter occurs an odd number of times.
Task description
Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns a string consisting of N lowercase letters (a−z) such that each letter occurs an odd number of times. We only care about occurrences of letters that appear at least once in the result.
Examples:
1. Given N = 4, the function may return "code" (each of the letters "c", "o", "d" and "e" occurs once). Other correct answers are: "cats", "uutu" or "xxxy".
2. Given N = 7, the function may return "gwgtgww" ("g" and "w" occur three times each and "t" occurs once).
3. Given N = 1, the function may return "z".
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    • N is an integer within the range [1..200,000].

2. DistinctLettersCount
Count the minimum number of letters that must be deleted from a word to create a word in which no two letters occur the same number of times.
Task description
Write a function:
def solution(S)
that, given a string S consisting of N lowercase letters, returns the minimum number of letters that must be deleted to obtain a word in which every letter occurs a unique number of times. We only care about occurrences of letters that appear at least once in result.
Examples:
1. Given S = "aaaabbbb", the function should return 1. We can delete one occurrence of a or one occurrence of b. Then one letter will occur four times and the other one three times.
2. Given S = "ccaaffddecee", the function should return 6. For example, we can delete all occurrences of e and f and one occurrence of d to obtain the word "ccaadc". Note that both e and f will occur zero times in the new word, but that is fine, since we only care about letters that appear at least once.
3. Given S = "eeee", the function should return 0 (there is no need to delete any characters).
4. Given S = "example", the function should return 4.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
    • N is an integer within the range [0..300,000];
    • string S consists only of lowercase letters (a−z).
